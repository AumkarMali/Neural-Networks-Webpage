            <h3>The Architecture of Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>
              Neural networks try to recreate the biology behind our brains artificially in order for computers to be able to process and detect more complex patterns. To illustrate the process behind this ability, we will be using a simple one-way feedforward version as an example, as this sequence of events is a crucial step in most neural network designs.
            </p>
            <h4>The Inner Workings</h4>
            <p>
              Neural networks are a cluster of nodes which act like a virtual equivalent of the neurons in your brain. These nodes connect with each other, passing ‚Äúsignals‚Äù through many layers, before arriving at an ultimate conclusion. Each of the nodes has a certain weight that makes it more or less influential in decision-making. They also have a signal threshold that must be exceeded before the node passes its signal down to the next layer of nodes. If this is not exceeded, the  node remains dormant. This threshold is known as a bias.
            </p>
            <h4>One Node at a Time</h4>
            <p>
              Each node takes the inputs from the previous layer‚Äôs activated nodes and incorporates them into a linear regression model. The input from each activated node is multiplied by its respective weight factor, giving it more/less importance in the outcome. The total weighted sum of all previous input nodes are then inputted into an activation function, which returns the final value produced by the node. If the value is higher than the bias, the node may activate and pass a signal down to connected nodes in the following layer. 
            </p>
            <h4>Through the Layers</h4>
            <p>
              The network starts at the input, where the information that is to be analyzed is passed into the system. The nodes start their work, performing their calculations and firing off to subsequent layers in what is known as the hidden layer of a neural network. How the nodes specifically react is unknown or hidden to us, as their weights and biases are determined by metrics the machine has devised to best optimize for accurate output during training. It is at this point after propagating through the entire network, that the final nodes send their signals and a result is produced in the output node, where the human gets the fruit of the neural network‚Äôs labour.
            </p>
            <h4>Training and Practice</h4>
            <p>
              Once we have created a neural network, we have to train it so that its internal parameters accurately predict the output of any given input related to the training data. One method of accomplishing this is by supervised learning: we take verified inputs and outputs and feed it to the system to allow it to learn from its mistakes. To measure accuracy, we can look at its mean squared value, or a cost/loss function. In the formula below ùëñ means index, ùë¶ ÃÇ (y-hat) means the predicted output, ùë¶ represents the actual output and m is the number of samples:
              <br>
              Cost Function = MSE =1/2ùëö ‚àë129_(ùëñ=1)^ùëö‚ñí(ùë¶ ÃÇ^((ùëñ) )‚àíùë¶^((ùëñ) ) )^2
              <br>
              During training, maintaining a low cost is of utmost importance for the network. If optimized properly, the cost function will return the lowest possible cost.
              <br>
              For more complex systems which backpropagate, the signals will fire backwards through the network to let the program analyze at which specific node errors or miscalculations had occurred. The adjustments made to nodes can be more finely tuned to target erroneous nodes only.
            </p>
            <h3>How Neural Networks Learn</h3>
            <p>
              There are two phases in the neural network cycle and in all machine learning algorithms in general. These are the training and prediction phases. In the training phase, the weight and bias values are determined, which are crucial parameters that define the behavior of the model. In a neural network, weights are values that modulate the inputs of each neuron, influencing the strength of the influence that each input has on the output. On the other hand, biases are additional parameters in a neural network that allow for shifts in the activation function, enabling each neuron to represent a broader range of behaviors. Neural networks obtain optimal bias values through error gradients. After determining the weights and biases during the training phase, the model proceeds to the prediction phase. The learned model, with its finely-tuned weights and biases, is applied to new, unseen data.

In the prediction phase, the input data is passed through the network, and each layer's weights and biases perform transformations on the data. These transformations are essentially learned features that the network utilizes to make accurate predictions. The output of the final layer is then utilized to generate a prediction or classification outcome.
